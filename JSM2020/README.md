### Thinking Beyond the P-Value: Advancing Bayesian Education for the Undergraduates 
#### Section on Bayesian Statistical Science, Section on Statistical Learning and Data Science, Section on Statistical Computing

- Quiz: Are You a Bayesian?
    - Alicia Johnson, Macalester College: Alicia is an associate professor of statistics at Macalester College whose interests span statistical computation, Bayesian statistics, and stat / data science education.

- Bayes for Undergraduates, A Prior is Modified
    - Jeff Witmer, Oberlin College: Jeff Witmer teaches statistics at Oberlin College. He has written a few books, none of them about Bayesian methods, but he has considered himself to be a Bayesian ever since his days in graduate school, approximately 60 years ago (give or take a couple of decades).
