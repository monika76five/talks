- **Quiz: Are You a Bayesian?**
    - Alicia Johnson, Macalester College
    - Bio: Alicia is an associate professor of statistics at Macalester College whose interests span statistical computation, Bayesian statistics, and stat / data science education.

- **Bayes for Undergraduates, A Prior is Modified**
    - Jeff Witmer, Oberlin College
    - Bio: Jeff Witmer teaches statistics at Oberlin College. He has written a few books, none of them about Bayesian methods, but he has considered himself to be a Bayesian ever since his days in graduate school, approximately 60 years ago (give or take a couple of decades).

- **Challenges of Teaching Bayesian Statistics to Undergraduates**
    - Brian Reich, North Carolina State University
    - Bio: Brian J Reich is the Gertrude M Cox Distinguished Professor of Statistics at North Carolina State University, Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Agricultural, Biological and Environmental Statistics, and author of the textbook “Bayesian Statistical methods”.  His research expertise is in the areas of Bayesian, spatial and environmental statistics.

- **Q \& A's** (mostly the posted questions from the chat and some comments from the audience; answers were given verbally by the presenters)
    1. What proportion of students end up being frequentists and Bayesian in your experience?
    2. I had a question for Jeff, How would he go about explaining the (CI) from a Frequentist approach vs. the Bayesian approach?
    3. INLA is a challenging thing to understand but makes spatio-temporal model faster, do you think it's good idea to teach them to undergrad level? 
    4. Question for Colin, what do you think of the package (cmdstanr) also running the mod$variational for quick model runs?
    5. So, did you say you use a lab for this class? How would that work with remote learning during coronavirus pandemic?
    6. A round of back and forth re variational Bayes:
        - Question for Jim, I was wondering if future additions of the book will include Variational Bayes.
    7. Jim - Thanks for great talk. I agree with your point about Stan vs JAGS (or even BUGS). Question: Do you recommend to students to use Directed Acyclical GRaphs when building a model prior to coding? I find this very helpful. Thanks.
    8. When proposing a Bayesian curriculum to an older program that is mostly frequentist, what advice do you have to convince them to teach Bayes?
    9. Alicia is there a Bookdown version of Bayes Rules!? What is the stat and math background you are assuming?
    10. Alicia - I'm not an educator. I love your "questions". Another concept would be to explain that Frequentist probabilities are of events in the data space and Bayesian probabilities are about events in the parameter space. Thus there is no either or. It is both.
    11. Thank you. A way around a strict interpretation of frequentism, like the p(rain) example, is if one defines 'today' by its X variables characteristics (geography, temp, air pressure, cloud cover, etc.), then days like 'today' may have happened repeatedly, and one can model and predict p(rain) without needing a Bayes interpretation for p(rain).
    12. Brian - loved the example. very motivating.
    13. I love this example. I used it this past year when I taught Bayes to undergrads using your book. I have received great feedback about your book from students! Students also like all the apps available on your website.
    14. If you were to successfully make these changes to the undergrad stat course, would you change the graduate Bayes course at all?
    15. Hi Jim, How do you handle big data problems using Bayesian techniques? *Answer from Jim: Dipak, honestly, I don't really do much big data Bayes.*
    16. Even if Jim does not do the Variational Bayes extension, it should be covered by someone if this trajectory leads to wide adoption!
    17. Jim's comment "why teach them more frequentist techniques instead of teaching them Bayesian thinking" is all important. Frequentist solutions are often one-off solutions that don't generalize.
    18. It's obvious to me Collin! Bayes is the way, and Variational Bayes has helped promote the Bayesian paradigm tremendously!
    19. Thanks. I know SAS isn't the main choice for Bayes, analyses, but more and more SAS procedures have Bayes options (proc mcmc for example), and would like to see more teaching with SAS since it is used a lot in industry too, and doesn't require much set up.
    20. Ernest, I think this maybe better included at a graduate level though. I get that this covers the basics.
    21. Do the presenters have any opinions about the pvalue "controversy"?
    22. Great point Collin! Variational Bayes gets quite heavy technically!
    23. David Blei gave a nice talk yesterday that further convinced me of the importance of bringing variational Bayes to the masses! Graduate level is the right level!
    24. Has any of the panelists found it difficult to convince their university of the inevitability or better yet the necessity of creating Bayesian courses at the undergraduate level?
    25. Comparing Bayesian p(H0 true) to a p-value is OK, but a difference doesn't necessarily mean the p-value is wrong though
