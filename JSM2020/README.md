- **Quiz: Are You a Bayesian?**
    - Alicia Johnson, Macalester College
    - Bio: Alicia is an associate professor of statistics at Macalester College whose interests span statistical computation, Bayesian statistics, and stat / data science education.

- **Bayes for Undergraduates, A Prior is Modified**
    - Jeff Witmer, Oberlin College
    - Bio: Jeff Witmer teaches statistics at Oberlin College. He has written a few books, none of them about Bayesian methods, but he has considered himself to be a Bayesian ever since his days in graduate school, approximately 60 years ago (give or take a couple of decades).
